                        <p class="fade-in">I am Roshanak Marefat, a fashion designer with a background rooted in hands-on craftsmanship and thoughtful design. From an early age, I was drawn to art, drawing, and visual expression, interests that naturally led me to fashion as a medium for storytelling and identity.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">I hold a degree in Fashion Design from Iran, where I developed a strong foundation in design thinking, garment construction, and pattern making.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">After graduating, I launched my own clothing brand, ROMA Fashion Design, an early exploration of lightness, femininity, and personal aesthetics. Wanting to deepen my experience, I went on to work with several established Iranian fashion brands, taking on roles that allowed me to engage with every stage of the process, from concept development to tailoring and final execution.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">After relocating to the Bay Area, I noticed how strongly people responded to the Iranian (Persian) patterns, textiles, and handcrafted details in my clothing. This experience encouraged me to more intentionally incorporate the art of Iranian textiles and traditional hand-sewn techniques&mdash;many of which are created by Iranian women&mdash;into my work. Today, I aim to reinterpret and elevate these cultural elements within a contemporary context, bringing them into my design practice in the United States.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">Now based in San Francisco, I am rebuilding my creative practice with renewed clarity and intention. My work is driven by authenticity, process, and material awareness, with a focus on clothing that feels personal, deliberate, and alive. I believe strong design emerges through patience, discipline, and an honest relationship with craft.</p>
